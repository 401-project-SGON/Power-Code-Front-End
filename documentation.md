# JS 401 Final Project / Power Code Academy /Front-End
***

## Overview:

Power Code Academy is an educational website that provides an interactive opportunity to learn different programming languages. We are committed to building a learning experience that allows for creating a user driven online learning experience for the future.

Traditional education is coupled with teaching methods that exist within schools that are no longer prevalent. As a result, many companies work to "disrupt" education by changing the way things work in the classroom and by providing lessons and educational materials online. We take references from modern technology innovators in creating an engaging learning experience from what we have done in the classroom.
